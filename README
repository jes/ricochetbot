This is a small wrapper around go-ricochet to provide an API that I find more intuitive.

If you want something more powerful you should use go-ricochet directly.

I have hacked up go-ricochet in some places because either it couldn't do things I wanted, or I couldn't work out how to do them.
That means ricochetbot needs to be used with my dirty version of go-ricochet instead of the clean version.

Still to implement:
 - automatically manage the tor process
 - built-in contacts management, with persistent state available
